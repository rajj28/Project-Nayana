# NAYANA: AI-Powered Threat Detection System

> **Enhancing National Security Through AI-Powered Thermal Vision**

---

## 📜 Overview

**NAYANA** is an advanced AI-powered thermal imaging security platform specifically engineered for **military applications**.  
It provides **real-time concealed weapon detection** and **suspicious movement analysis** even in **low-visibility or zero-light conditions**.

By utilizing **high-resolution thermal cameras**, **AI-driven image processing**, and **advanced motion tracking algorithms**, NAYANA can detect threats with **over 90% accuracy**.

> **Status:** Under Development

---

## 🎯 Military Applications

- **Military Base Security**: Enhanced perimeter monitoring and intrusion detection
- **Border Security Operations**: All-weather, 24/7 surveillance capabilities
- **Urban Defense**: Real-time tracking of suspicious movements and concealed threats
- **Counter-terrorism Operations**: Early detection of hidden weapons and explosive devices

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Concealed Weapon Detection**: Identifies hidden firearms and explosives via thermal signatures
- **Suspicious Movement Analysis**: Tracks and classifies unusual behavior patterns
- **Low-Light Operation**: Operates effectively in complete darkness and adverse weather
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Distinguishes threats from non-threats to minimize false positives
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Generates instant notifications (<500ms) upon threat detection
- **Non-invasive Security**: Screen without direct contact or subject awareness

SO THERE IS MOVEMENT DETECTION AND THOSE MOVEMENTS ARE TRUELY SUSPICIOUS , HERE IS WHEN NAYANA COMES IN , EVEN UNDER NO SERVILLANCE NAYANA WOULD REPLACE 24/7 WATCHING OVER THE CAMERA SAVING HUMAN EFFORTS AND ALRAM THE AUTHORITY IF THE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY IS DETECTED.
